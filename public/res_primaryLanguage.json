      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matthew Gebhart. I'm a jack-of-all trades with experience and knowledge in many different areas. This stems from my life-long curiosity and love of learning which so far has formally included a Bachelors in Political Science and a Masters of Divinity. I am known for my creative endeavors, for communication, and skills in working with people. I have many years of experience developing and leading effective teams focused on mission specific outcomes. I'm in the middle of a career transition away from working with churches and I'm in the process of learning software development at Codefellows. I also operated a wedding photography business for over 10 years and currently have a side-project woodworking business (zoewoodworks.com). I am a creative at heart and view most tasks as a creative process. I love building things and taking ideas from design to development to completion. I'm learning software development to gain skills that I hope to use in the non-profit sector specifically in the areas of environmental justice or advocacy for marginalized communities. My goal is to use my skills to help all human beings as well as our planet to thrive and flourish.",
